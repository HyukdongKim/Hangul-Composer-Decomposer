# Hangul Converter

A simple utility to convert between Hangul syllables and their individual components (initial consonant, medial vowel, and final consonant).

## Features

- Convert from individual Hangul components to a combined syllable.
- Decompose a Hangul syllable into its individual components.

## Usage

1. **Converting to a Syllable**:

```python
syllable = composer(initial, medial, final)
```

Example:

```python
syllable = composer('ㅅ', 'ㅏ', 'ㅇ')
print(syllable)  # Outputs: 상
```

2. **Decomposing a Syllable**:

```python
initial, medial, final = decomposer(syllable)
```

Example:

```python
initial, medial, final = decomposer('상')
print(initial, medial, final)  # Outputs: ㅅ ㅏ ㅇ
```
